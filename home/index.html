                        The onion has been cultivated for 4700 years or more and does not exist as a wild species. Onion was probably first domesticated in the mountainous regions of Turkmenistan and north Iran bordering the ancient advanced civilizations of the Near East (Sumerian). Therefore, south-west Asia is regarded as being the primary centre of domestication and variability. Other regions of great diversity like the Mediterranean are considered secondary centres (Hanelt, 1990; Fritsch and Friesen, 2002). The nearest wild relative in the subgenus Cepa section Cepa is A. vavilovii (Klaas and Friesen, 2002), which is found in the Koppet Dag mountains of Turkmenistan. It has a hollow scape with a bubble-like swelling, but the leaves are completely flat. Recent molecular studies have shown that A. asarense is basal to the group, which includes A. cepa and A. vavilovii (Fritsch and Friesen, 2002). This has only very recently been discovered at a single site in the Elburz range near Tehran. It grows on steep, rocky slopes and the plants have semi-cylindrical leaves and a flower stem with a bubble-like inflation. It has globose umbels of greenish browntinged flowers.
                        Hanelt (1990) describes how domestication of onions may have originated as illustrated by A. pskemense, another wild, large-bulb species of the section Cepa. This grows in the western Tien Shan mountains of Uzbekistan and Kazakhstan, and inhabitants of some valleys transplant it to their gardens where it is cultivated and propagated. During domestication of onions, selection for faster growth, leading to a biennial rather than a longer life cycle, and for larger bulbs must have occurred. Also, barriers to crossing with related species must have developed. 
                        Cultivated types of A. cepa fall into two broad horticultural groups, the Common Onion group and the Aggregatum group (Hanelt, 1990). 
                        The Common Onion group constitutes the vast bulk of the economically important varieties. These form large, single bulbs and are mostly grown from seed. Varieties grown for salad onions and as small bulbs for pickling are mainly from this group. There is great diversity in adaptation to photoperiod and temperature, in bulb storage life, dry-matter content, flavour and skin colour.

                <div class="right-container">
                        The bulbs of the Aggregatum group are smaller than the common onion because they rapidly divide and form laterals, hence forming clusters of bulbs. Jones and Mann (1963) distinguished two bulb-forming subgroups: multiplier, or potato, onions and shallots. Multiplier onions divide into between three and 20 bulbs that are wider than they are long, and which are encased by the dry, outer bulb skins. Shallots form clusters of narrow, separate bulbs, and the leaves and flowers are usually smaller than those of common onions. The Aggregatum group is usually vegetatively propagated but, recently, improved seed-reproduced varieties of shallots have been bred and are being widely grown in Europe, Israel and North America. Hybrid cultivars have been developed in Israel and Holland using cytoplasmic male sterility (Rabinowitch and Kamenetsky, 2002). There has, however, been some dispute as to whether such seed-reproduced cultivars truly constitute shallots from the producers of traditional, vegetatively propagated varieties in France. 
                        When flowers form, they are interfertile with the Common Onion group, and therefore they are the same species. In view of this, the specific name A. ascalonicum, used for shallots in the past, is not justified. The Aggregatum group are not so important commercially as the Common Onion group, and many are grown as home garden crops; however, large-scale cultivation of shallots takes place in Europe, North America, Argentina and in some tropical regions. In France they are favoured for their special flavour and cooking quality as compared with common onions. Vegetatively propagated onions like multiplier or potato onions are traditionally grown in Finland and northern Russia (Aura, 1963). Shallots are also suitable for such high-latitude regions with a short growing season. 
                        Interestingly, at the other extreme of the latitude range, in the humid tropics – particularly in lowland coastal regions, shallots and multiplier onions are again found to be the most satisfactory way of producing A. cepa bulbs (Currah, 2002). In these conditions, pressure from pests and diseases causing leaf damage is intense, and shallots and multiplier onions can complete a cycle of leaf growth and bulbing in 60–75 days, whereas onions grown from seed need a longer season of leaf growth, during which they are vulnerable to pest and disease attack (Currah and Proctor, 1990). Furthermore small seedlings, unlike larger, vegetatively propagated plants, lack the reserves to recover from leaf damage.

                Garlic is thought to have evolved from wild ancestors in a broad area of central Asia stretching from the Tien Shan mountains in the east to the Caucasus in the west. Some authorities consider that A. longicuspis is a separate species from which garlic evolved, but others consider that A. longicuspis is a wild or feral form of garlic (Fritsch and Friesen, 2002). Allium tuncelianum has also been suggested as an ancestor of both garlic and A. longicuspis. It smells like garlic and has similar floral morphology, but it is a non-bulbing species. The natural habitat of ancestral garlic was probably gullies and rocky valleys where some water was available, in arid or semi-arid areas. Garlic bulbs in summer and can therefore survive periods of extreme dryness as a dormant bulb. It is also very cold-hardy. Fritsch and Friesen (2002) divided garlic into several informal cultivar groups: 
                ● the Longicuspis group of Central Asia, which bolt and some of which are still seed fertile and which also produce many small top-sets. 
                ● the Sativum group from the Mediterranean, which includes bolting and non-bolting types. 
                ● the Ophioscorodon group from central and eastern Europe, which bolt and produce long, coiling scapes with few large top-sets.
                ● the Pekinense group of China, which are derived from the longicuspis group but are smaller and produce a few large top-sets. 
                ● the Subtropical group from India, Vietnam and Myanmar, which have small bulbs and are selected for eating as fresh leaves.

                Garlic clones exist that are adapted to many ecological zones through their responses of growth and bulbing to temperature and photoperiod, their coldhardiness and duration of bulb dormancy (Takagi, 1990). Diversity also exists in the size of cloves, their number, bulb weight, colour and number of outer skins and size and vigour of the foliage, and the extent to which inflorescences occur. On the basis of a comparison of a wide range of clones growing in a standard environment, Jones and Mann (1963) concluded that there was no justification for using some of the subspecies names previously ascribed to some variants of garlic. They suggested that the name ‘Rocambole’ might be applied to variants with coiled scapes, but should not be applied to the wild species A. scorodoprasum. This has occasionally been so named and it has been used for food but it is not cultivated. Messiaen et al. (1993) compared the garlic varieties grown in all parts of the world, except Asia, in comparative trials in France and classified them into six groups characterized by the presence or absence of flower stalks, the size and number of the cloves and their degree of dormancy, and the earliness of bulbing in the trials.

                    This species includes several distinct crop types, but where they have been crossed they have proved interfertile and are therefore variants of the one species. Wild A. ampeloprasum is found from Portugal in the west through the Mediterranean countries to western Iran in the east (van der Meer and Hanelt, 1990; Kik, 2002). It grows wild in open, often man-made, habitats, on cliffs and in scrubby vegetation. The wild types produce small bulbs, either close to the mother bulb or, in some variants, on short stolons. Wild relatives have been successfully crossed with cultivated leeks (Kik, 2002). 
                    There are five horticultural groups: the Leek group, the Kurrat group, the Taree group, the Great-headed Garlic group and the Pearl Onion group.
                    In leeks the development of concentric, ensheathing leaf bases has been selected so that they form long, edible ‘pseudostems’ at harvest. Different types vary in the length and slenderness of the pseudostem. Turkish and Bulgarian types have long, thin pseudostems, whereas those from Western Europe have shorter, thicker pseudostems (van der Meer and Hanelt, 1990). Leeks do not normally bulb but, after flowering, bulb cloves frequently form in the leaf axil at the base of the flower stalk. Leeks are tetraploids with a chromosome number of 32. The flowers have light purple tepals and are produced in globose umbels. Leeks are an important crop in Europe. They are raised from seed. They are well adapted to growing in cool conditions and are harvested throughout the winter in maritime countries of Western Europe. Many of the older cultivars of Western Europe are being supplanted by newer, mainly Dutch-bred, cultivars, including hybrids, which have been developed since the 1990s (Smith and Crowther, 1995). Because leeks, in contrast to onions, do not have specific photoperiod requirements for development, varieties can be grown over a wide range of latitudes. The name A. porrum was given to leek by Linnaeus, and this name is still quite widely used.

            <div class="right-container">
                In kurrat the emphasis of selection has been for edible leaves, and the pseudostem is quite short. The crop is popular in Egypt where the leaves are repeatedly cut and harvested every 3–4 weeks over a period of up to 18 months. It is grown from seeds and is tetraploid, like leek, with which it is easily crossable to give morphologically intermediate and fertile offspring. The Taree group, which is sometimes included in the Kurrat group, is a narrow-leafed form cultivated as a leafy condiment in northern Iran. 
                Great-headed garlic has the appearance of a very robust garlic plant. It produces a large, leek-like inflorescence, but any seeds produced are sterile and it rarely forms top-sets in the inflorescence (Jones and Mann, 1963). It is therefore propagated from the cloves, which are like large garlic cloves. Six large cloves typically surround the base of the flower stalk, sometimes with smaller cloves encased in the wrapper leaves of the bulb. If the plant does not flower, the bulb consists of a single, large clove, termed a ‘round’. Great-headed garlic is hexaploid, with a chromosome number of 48. The flavour is similar to that of garlic and it is often confused with garlic by gardeners. Cultivation is reported from Greece and Egypt and through south-west Asia to India, often on a small scale. 
                Pearl onion is a minor, home-garden crop in Germany which has, in the past, been grown commercially in The Netherlands. Each plant, which is like a small leek without a pronounced pseudostem, forms a cluster of near-spherical, white-skinned bulbs which are summer dormant. The plants are winter hardy and, although they are normally propagated from small bulbs, they can flower and produce fertile seed and can be crossed with leeks (van der Meer and Hanelt, 1990).

                This is the most widely distributed allium species. It grows wild in Eurasia and America and, being very cold hardy during its winter dormancy, it grows in arctic regions at latitudes as high as 70°N. At low latitudes it grows in mountainous areas – for example, in northern India. It is a plant of moist soils in damp meadows. Chives have been grown for their green, onion-flavoured leaves as a crop in Europe since the 16th century (Poulsen, 1990). In the wild, many ecotypes and biotypes differing in size exist, but these have been shown to be interfertile, and therefore all of the same species. The wild species is also very variable in its chromosome number. Diploids, with 16 chromosomes and tetraploids, with 32 occur, as do irregular chromosome numbers that are not multiples of 8.

                The plants form dense clumps of low-growing, narrow, hollow leaves. An axillary bud develops and forms a side shoot after every two or three leaves has formed, and thereby the plants develop into a cluster of shoots. The shoots remain attached to each other on a short rhizome, and the plants do not produce bulbs. The plants become dormant in short day-lengths.
                The plants are propagated vegetatively or from seed, the latter being more important for the commercial crop. Most seed is produced by open pollination of selected plants. The utilization of male sterility has enabled large-leaved F1 hybrids to be bred, which are high yielding as ‘forced’ winter greenhouse crops in Germany.
